# Coding School Kata

The LOC kata seems really interesting. In the first moment, it seems pretty simple but some edge cases has made it a little bit more complex.

There are 2 implementations:

- Without Regular expression (Not solve all the cases, but nicer code);
- With Regular expression in order to get most of the cases.
